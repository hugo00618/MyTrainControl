# Project TrainControl
To implement an autonomous DCC model railway control system with Arduino DCC++ command station and JMRI API.

## Features

### Acceleration / Deceleration
Emulate the acceleration and deceleration of the train.

### Distance Control
Control the train to move for a certain distance, based on the preset speed mapping.

### Layout Construction and Path Finding
A JSON layout decoder which constructs the layout in code and integrates path finding algorithm into it.

### Block Section Operation
Enable block section operation which prevents train collision.

## WIP Features

### Sensor Support
Add support for IR sensors which could help improve the accuracy of Distance Control.

### Support for Turnouts
Add turnout support.

### Fully Autonomous Operation
To have all the trains in the system to operate autonomously.
